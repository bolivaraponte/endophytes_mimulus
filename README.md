# Foliar fungal symbionts in sympatric yellow monkeyflowers along an elevational gradient in the Sierra Nevada, California, USA

## Bioinformatics Pipeline: DADA2

## Objective

This project aims to explore and characterize the endophytes found oin leaf tissue of *Mimulus guttatus*, *Mimulus laciniatus*, *Mimulus nasutus* and others along an elevational gradient in the Sierra Nevada, California, USA. 

The pipeline is mainly focused on the DADA2 pipeline presented by Benjamin Callahan et al. in its [ITS](https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/ITS_workflow.html) and [16S](https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/tutorial.html) variants. The pipeline follows closely the DADA2 mentioned previously, the work of Mareli Sánchez Juliá for her MAMF project, and Farrer Lab at Tulane University. The USEARCH and VSEARCH steps or alternatives stem from the Arnold Lab at the University of Arizona.

The list below is to help guide your search and aid your bioinformatics journey. Each project and sequencing run is different and should be treated as such. Determine the parameters to filter, cut, trim and truncate accordingly.

### Reference pipelines
   + [VBL_Bioinformatics](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Z4jHQDcS4dOpG6hlkXVWMw72tZeCYYRH&usp=drive_fs) folder in the Google Drive were you can find scripts and notes on bioinfomatic pipelines from past graduate students and post-docs.
   + [Farrer Lab](https://github.com/ecfarrer/LAmarshGradient2/blob/master/BioinformaticsITS.R) repository. They work on similar data sets.
