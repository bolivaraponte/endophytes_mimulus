  abstract = {Massively parallel sequencing has revolutionized many areas of biology, but sequencing large amounts of DNA in many individuals is cost-prohibitive and unnecessary for many studies. Genomic complexity reduction techniques such as sequence capture and restriction enzyme-based methods enable the analysis of many more individuals per unit cost. Despite their utility, current complexity reduction methods have limitations, especially when large numbers of individuals are analyzed. Here we develop a much improved restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing protocol and a new method called Rapture (RAD capture). The new RAD protocol improves versatility by separating RAD tag isolation and sequencing library preparation into two distinct steps. This protocol also recovers more unique (nonclonal) RAD fragments, which improves both standard RAD and Rapture analysis. Rapture then uses an in-solution capture of chosen RAD tags to target sequencing reads to desired loci. Rapture combines the benefits of both RAD and sequence capture, i.e., very inexpensive and rapid library preparation for many individuals as well as high specificity in the number and location of genomic loci analyzed. Our results demonstrate that Rapture is a rapid and flexible technology capable of analyzing a very large number of individuals with minimal sequencing and library preparation cost. The methods presented here should improve the efficiency of genetic analysis for many aspects of agricultural, environmental, and biomedical science.},

Fungal endophytes associated with leaves of woody angiosperms are especially diverse; yet, fundamental aspects of their interactions with hosts are unknown. In contrast to the relatively species-poor endophytes that are vertically transmitted and act as defensive mutualists of some temperate grasses, the diverse, horizontally transmitted endophytes of woody angio-sperms are thought to contribute little to host defense. Here, we document high diversity, spatial structure, and host affinity among foliar endophytes associated with a tropical tree (Theobroma cacao, Malvaceae) across lowland Panama. We then show that inoculation of endophyte-free leaves with endophytes isolated frequently from naturally infected, asymptomatic hosts signifi-cantly decreases both leaf necrosis and leaf mortality when T. cacao seedlings are challenged with a major pathogen (Phytophthora sp.). In contrast to reports of fungal inoculation inducing systemic defense, we found that protection was primarily localized to endophyte-infected tissues. Further, endophyte-mediated protec-tion was greater in mature leaves, which bear less intrinsic defense against fungal pathogens than do young leaves. In vitro studies suggest that host affinity is mediated by leaf chemistry, and that protection may be mediated by direct interactions of endophytes with foliar pathogens. Together, these data demonstrate the capacity of diverse, horizontally transmitted endophytes of woody angiosperms to play an important but previously unappreciated role in host defense.}

Flowers are well-replicated habitat islands, among which the microbes disperse via pollinators. This metapopulation system allows for investigation of microbial distribution at multiple spatial scales. We examined the distribution of the yeast, Metschnikowia reukaufii, and other fungal species found in the floral nectar of the sticky monkey flower, Mimulus aurantiacus, a hummingbird-pollinated shrub, at a California site. We found that the frequency of nectarinhabiting microfungi on a given host plant was not significantly correlated with light availability, nectar volume or the percent cover of M. aurantiacus around the plant, but was significantly correlated with the location of the host plant and loosely correlated with the density of flowers on the plant. These results suggest that dispersal limitation caused by spatially non-random foraging by pollinators may be a primary factor driving the observed distribution pattern.},

  abstract = {Abstract             In ecological speciation, incipient species diverge due to natural selection that is ecologically based. In flowering plants, different pollinators could mediate that selection (pollinator-mediated divergent selection) or other features of the environment that differ between habitats of 2 species could do so (environment-mediated divergent selection). Although these mechanisms are well understood, they have received little rigorous testing, as few studies of divergent selection across sites of closely related species include both floral traits that influence pollination and vegetative traits that influence survival. This study employed common gardens in sites of the 2 parental species and a hybrid site, each containing advanced generation hybrids along with the parental species, to test these forms of ecological speciation in plants of the genus Ipomopsis. A total of 3 vegetative traits (specific leaf area, leaf trichomes, and photosynthetic water-use efficiency) and 5 floral traits (corolla length and width, anther insertion, petal color, and nectar production) were analyzed for impacts on fitness components (survival to flowering and seeds per flower, respectively). These traits exhibited strong clines across the elevational gradient in the hybrid zone, with narrower clines in theory reflecting stronger selection or higher genetic variance. Plants with long corollas and inserted anthers had higher seeds per flower at the Ipomopsis tenuituba site, whereas selection favored the reverse condition at the Ipomopsis aggregata site, a signature of divergent selection. In contrast, no divergent selection due to variation in survival was detected on any vegetative trait. Selection within the hybrid zone most closely resembled selection within the I. aggregata site. Across traits, the strength of divergent selection was not significantly correlated with width of the cline, which was better predicted by evolvability (standardized genetic variance). These results support the role of pollinator-­mediated divergent selection in ecological speciation and illustrate the importance of genetic variance in determining divergence across hybrid zones.},

  abstract = {Clines in phenotypic traits with an underlying genetic basis potentially implicate natural selection. However, neutral evolutionary processes such as random colonization, spatially restricted gene flow, and genetic drift could also result in similar spatial patterns, especially for single-locus traits because of their susceptibility to stochastic events. One way to distinguish between adaptive and neutral mechanisms is to compare the focal trait to neutral genetic loci to determine whether neutral loci demonstrate clinal variation (consistent with a neutral cline), or not. Ivyleaf morning glory, Ipomoea hederacea, exhibits a latitudinal cline for a Mendelian leaf shape polymorphism in eastern North America, such that lobed genotypes dominate northern populations and heart-shaped genotypes are restricted to southern populations. Here, we evaluate potential evolutionary mechanisms for this cline by first determining the allele frequencies at the leaf shape locus for 77 populations distributed throughout I.~hederacea's range and then comparing the geographical pattern at this locus to neutral amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) loci. We detected both significant clinal variation and high genetic differentiation at the leaf shape locus across all populations. In contrast, 99\% of the putatively neutral loci do not display clinal variation, and I.~hederacea populations show very little overall genetic differentiation, suggesting that there is a moderate level of gene flow. In addition, the leaf shape locus was identified as a major F(ST) outlier experiencing divergent selection, relative to all the AFLP loci. Together, these data strongly suggest that the cline in leaf shape is being maintained by spatially varying natural selection.},

In this review, we summarize concepts underlying fungal dispersal, review recent research, and explore how fungi possess unique characteristics that can broaden our understanding of general dispersal ecology. We highlight emerging frontiers in fungal dispersal research that integrate technological advances with trait-based ecology, movement ecology, social–ecological systems, and work in unexplored environments. Outstanding research questions across these themes are presented to stimulate theoretical and empirical research in fungal dispersal ecology. Advances in fungal dispersal will improve our understanding of fungal community assembly and biogeography across a range of spatial scales, with implications for ecosystem functioning, global food security, and human health.},

  abstract = {Selection on quantitative traits by heterogeneous climatic conditions can lead to substantial trait variation across a species range. In the context of rapidly changing environments, however, it is equally important to understand selection on trait plasticity. To evaluate the role of selection in driving divergences in traits and their associated plasticities within a widespread species, we compared molecular and quantitative trait variation in Populus fremontii (Fremont cottonwood), a foundation riparian distributed throughout Arizona. Using SNP data and genotypes from 16 populations reciprocally planted in three common gardens, we first performed QST-­FST analyses to detect selection on traits and trait plasticity. We then explored the environmental drivers of selection using trait-­climate and plasticity-c­ limate regressions. Three major findings emerged: (1) There was significant genetic variation in traits expressed in each of the common gardens and in the phenotypic plasticity of traits across gardens, both of which were heritable. (2) Based on QST-­FST comparisons, there was evidence of selection in all traits measured; however, this result varied from no effect in one garden to highly significant in another, indicating that detection of past selection is environmentally dependent. We also found strong evidence of divergent selection on plasticity across environments for two traits. (3) Traits and/or their plasticity were often correlated with population source climate (R2 up to .77 and .66, respectively). These results suggest that steep climate gradients across the Southwest have played a major role in shaping the evolution of divergent phenotypic responses in populations and genotypes now experiencing climate change.},

Theory predicts that early-onset hybrid inviability may stem from conflict between parents for resource allocation to offspring.

HSI between             M. guttatus             and             M. decorus             is common and strong, but populations of             M. decorus             vary in the magnitude and directionality of HSI with             M. guttatus             . Patterns of HSI between             M. guttatus             and             M. decorus             , as well as within             M. decorus             conform to the predictions of parental conflict: (1) reciprocal F1s exhibit size differences and parent-of-origin specific endosperm defects, (2) the extent of asymmetry between reciprocal F1 seed size is correlated with asymmetry in HSI, and (3) inferred differences in the extent of conflict predict the extent of HSI between populations. We also find that HSI is rapidly evolving, as populations that exhibit the most HSI are each others’ closest relative. Lastly, while all populations are largely outcrossing, we find that the differences in the inferred strength of conflict scale positively with π, suggesting that demographic or life history factors other than mating system may also influence the rate of parental conflict driven evolution. Overall, these patterns suggest the rapid evolution of parent-of-origin specific resource allocation alleles coincident with HSI within and between             M. guttatus             and             M. decorus.             Parental conflict may therefore be an important evolutionary driver of reproductive isolation.},

By forming mutually beneficial symbioses, microbes helped plants colonize land more than 450 million years ago. In parallel, omnipresent pathogens led to the emergence of innovative defense strategies. The evolution of plant-microbe interactions encompasses ancient conserved gene modules, recurrent concepts, and the fast-paced emergence of lineage-specific innovations. Microbes form communities on the surface or inside plant tissues and organs, and most intimately, microbes live within single plant cells. Intracellular colonization is established and controlled in part by plant genes that underpin general cell processes and defense mechanisms. To benefit from microbes, plants also evolved genetic modules for symbiosis support. These modules have been maintained despite the risk of getting hijacked by pathogens.                                         ADVANCES               The hundreds of land plant and algal genomes that are now available enable genome-wide comparisons of gene families associated with plant immunity and symbiosis. Reconstruction of gene phylogenies and large-scale comparative phylogenomic approaches have revealed an ancient subset of genes coevolving with the widespread arbuscular mycorrhiza symbiosis, the most ancient plant intracellular symbiosis, and with other types of more recently evolved intracellular symbioses in vascular and nonvascular plants. Intercellular symbiotic interactions formed with cyanobacteria or ectomycorrhizal fungi seem to repeatedly evolve through convergent, but not necessarily genetically conserved, mechanisms. Phylogenetic analyses revealed occurrence of candidate disease-resistance genes in green algae, as well as orthologs of flowering plant genes involved in symbiosis signaling and sensing microbial patterns. Yet, more research is needed to understand their functional conservation.                                The extent to which conserved symbiosis genes also fulfill often opposing roles during pathogen-plant interactions is being explored through studies of pathogen infections in plants capable of supporting symbiotic relationships. The development of plant-microbe systems in genetically tractable species covering the diversity of land plant lineages—including angiosperms and bryophytes, such as the liverwort                 Marchantia polymorpha                 —makes it possible to test hypotheses that emerge from phylogenetic analyses, linking genetic and functional conservation across land plants. Studies in bryophytes illustrate the range of possibilities for pathogen management: ancient genes, such as membrane receptors that perceive fungus-derived chitin; pathways with bryophyte clade–specific components, such as phenylpropanoid-derived auronidin stress metabolites; and jasmonate-like hormonal signaling for immunity.                                                        OUTLOOK               Only a few plant-microbe interactions have been studied in depth, and those in only a few land plant lineages. Future investigations of interactions occurring across the diversity of plants may unravel new types of symbiotic or pathogenic interactions. The occurrence of microbe-sensing genes in streptophyte algae, harboring the closest algal relative to land plants, suggest the existence of overlooked and potentially ancient symbiotic associations. Genetically tractable plant-microbe model systems in diverse streptophyte algae, hornworts, liverworts, ferns, and the so far unsampled diversity of seed plants will enable dissection of the spectrum of molecular mechanisms that regulate the breadth of interactions occurring in plants. The actual function of the symbiotic genes present in bryophyte genomes also remains to be determined. Furthermore, our understanding of plant-microbe interactions will be enriched by more often combining evolutionary concepts with mechanistic studies. More efforts are needed to decipher the molecular changes that have enabled the emergence of new interactions, signaling pathways, and enzymatic specificities to support symbiosis and to protect against pathogens. Microbes manipulate plant processes, and complementary microbial studies are key to gaining a complete picture of plant-microbe evolution. Knowing the rules of engagement between distantly related plants and their microbes then helps genetic transplantation approaches into crops and the orthogonal engineering of bioprocesses aimed at achieving quantitative resistance against pathogens, improving phosphate uptake, or establishing nitrogen-fixing associations for efficient use in sustainable agriculture.                                                   Ancient friends and recent enemies shape plant evolution.                                        Some pathogens such as oomycetes are able to infect a wide range of extant plant lineages, including bryophytes (left), and plant pathogen interactions often evolve at a fast pace. By contrast, some symbiotic interactions that look exactly as they do today can be found in the most ancient land plant fossils, here depicted as an illustration of the Rhynie chert fossil plant                     Aglaophyton major                     (right). Still, both types of plant-microbe interactions feature evolutionarily ancient as well as rapidly evolving aspects. Extending plant-microbe studies across diverse groups of plant lineages has enriched our understanding of these processes and their evolution.                                                                                            ,              During 450 million years of diversification on land, plants and microbes have evolved together. This is reflected in today’s continuum of associations, ranging from parasitism to mutualism. Through phylogenetics, cell biology, and reverse genetics extending beyond flowering plants into bryophytes, scientists have started to unravel the genetic basis and evolutionary trajectories of plant-microbe associations. Protection against pathogens and support of beneficial, symbiotic, microorganisms are sustained by a blend of conserved and clade-specific plant mechanisms evolving at different speeds. We propose that symbiosis consistently emerges from the co-option of protection mechanisms and general cell biology principles. Exploring and harnessing the diversity of molecular mechanisms used in nonflowering plant-microbe interactions may extend the possibilities for engineering symbiosis-competent and pathogen-resilient crops.},

In plants, local speciation, where small populations split off from a large-ranged progenitor species, is thought to be the dominant mode, yet there are still few examples to verify speciation has occurred in this manner. A recently described morphological species in the yellow monkey flowers, Mimulus filicifolius, is an excellent candidate for local speciation because of its highly restricted geographical range. Mimulus filicifolius was formerly identified as a population of M. laciniatus due to similar lobed leaf morphology and rocky outcrop habitat. To investigate whether M. filicifolius is genetically divergent and reproductively isolated from M. laciniatus, we examined patterns of genetic diversity in ten nuclear and eight microsatellite loci, and hybrid fertility in M. filicifolius and its purported close relatives: M. laciniatus, M. guttatus and M. nasutus. We found that M. filicifolius is genetically divergent from the other species and strongly reproductively isolated from M. laciniatus. We conclude that M. filicifolius is an independent rock outcrop specialist despite being morphologically and ecologically similar to M. laciniatus, and that its small geographical range nested within other wide-ranging members of the M. guttatus species complex is consistent with local speciation.},

  abstract = {Background and Aims The genetic basis of leaf shape has long interested botanists because leaf shape varies extensively across the plant kingdom and this variation is probably adaptive. However, knowledge of the genetic architecture of leaf shape variation in natural populations remains limited. This study examined the genetic architecture of leaf shape diversification among three edaphic specialists in the Mimulus guttatus species complex. Lobed and narrow leaves have evolved from the entire, round leaves of M. guttatus in M. laciniatus, M. nudatus and a polymorphic serpentine M. guttatus population (M2L). Methods Bulk segregant analysis and next-generation sequencing were used to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that underlie leaf shape in an M. laciniatus∈×∈M. guttatus F2 population. To determine whether the same QTLs contribute to leaf shape variation in M. nudatus and M2L, F2s from M. guttatus∈×∈M. nudatus and lobed M2L∈×∈unlobed M. guttatus crosses were genotyped at QTLs from the bulk segregant analysis. Key Results Narrow and lobed leaf shapes in M. laciniatus, M. nudatus and M. guttatus are controlled by overlapping genetic regions. Several promising leaf shape candidate genes were found under each QTL. Conclusions The evolution of divergent leaf shape has taken place multiple times in the M. guttatus species complex and is associated with the occupation of dry, rocky environments. The genetic architecture of elongated and lobed leaves is similar across three species in this group. This may indicate that parallel genetic evolution from standing variation or new mutations is responsible for the putatively adaptive leaf shape variation in Mimulus.},

  abstract = {Identifying the individual loci and mutations that underlie adaptation to extreme environments has long been a goal of evolutionary biology. However, finding the genes that underlie adaptive traits is difficult for several reasons. First, because many traits and genes evolve simultaneously as populations diverge, it is difficult to disentangle adaptation from neutral demographic processes. Second, finding the individual loci involved in any trait is challenging given the respective limitations of quantitative and population genetic methods. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Hendrick et~al. (2016) overcome these difficulties and determine the genetic basis of microgeographic adaptation between geothermal vent and nonthermal populations of Mimulus guttatus in Yellowstone National Park. The authors accomplish this by combining population and quantitative genetic techniques, a powerful, but labour-intensive, strategy for identifying individual causative adaptive loci that few studies have used (Stinchcombe \& Hoekstra ). In a previous common garden experiment (Lekberg et~al. 2012), thermal M.~guttatus populations were found to differ from their closely related nonthermal neighbours in various adaptive phenotypes including trichome density. Hendrick et~al. (2016) combine quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping, population genomic scans for selection and admixture mapping to identify a single genetic locus underlying differences in trichome density between thermal and nonthermal M.~guttatus. The candidate gene, R2R3 MYB, is homologous to genes involved in trichome development across flowering plants. The major trichome QTL, Tr14, is also involved in trichome density differences in an independent M.~guttatus population comparison (Holeski et~al. 2010) making this an example of parallel genetic evolution.},

  abstract = {The genetic architecture of local adaptation has been of central interest to evolutionary biologists since the modern synthesis. In addition to classic theory on the effect size of adaptive mutations by Fisher, Kimura and Orr, recent theory addresses the genetic architecture of local adaptation in the face of ongoing gene flow. This theory predicts that with substantial gene flow between populations local adaptation should proceed primarily through mutations of large effect or tightly linked clusters of smaller effect loci. In this study, we investigate the genetic architecture of divergence in flowering time, mating system-related traits, and leaf shape between Mimulus laciniatus and a sympatric population of its close relative M.~guttatus. These three traits are probably involved in M.~laciniatus' adaptation to a dry, exposed granite outcrop environment. Flowering time and mating system differences are also reproductive isolating barriers making them 'magic traits'. Phenotypic hybrids in this population provide evidence of recent gene flow. Using next-generation sequencing, we generate dense SNP markers across the genome and map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) involved in flowering time, flower size and leaf shape. We find that interspecific divergence in all three traits is due to few QTL of large effect including a highly pleiotropic QTL on chromosome 8. This QTL region contains the pleiotropic candidate gene TCP4 and is involved in ecologically important phenotypes in other Mimulus species. Our results are consistent with theory, indicating that local adaptation and reproductive isolation with gene flow should be due to few loci with large and pleiotropic effects.},

Here, we investigate the ecological variables and traits that underlie Mimulus laciniatus’ adaptation to granite outcrops compared to its sympatric, mesic-adapted progenitor, Mimulus guttatus. We use fine-scale measurements of soil moisture and herbivory to examine differences in selective forces between the species’ habitats, and measure selection on flowering time, flower size, plant height, and leaf shape in a reciprocal transplant using M.~laciniatus~× M.~guttatus F4 hybrids. We find that differences in drought and herbivory drive survival differences between habitats, that M.~laciniatus and M.~guttatus are each better adapted to their native habitat, and differential habitat selection on flowering time, plant stature, and leaf shape. Although early flowering time, small stature, and lobed leaf shape underlie plant fitness in M.~laciniatus’ seasonally dry environment, increased plant size is advantageous in a competitive mesic environment replete with herbivores like M.~guttatus’. Given that we observed divergent selection between habitats in the direction of species differences, we conclude that adaptation to different microhabitats is an important component of reproductive isolation in this sympatric species pair.},

We have tested the specificity of these primers against 13 species of ascomycetes, 14 of basidiomycetes, and 15 of plants. Our results showed that ITS4‐B, when paired with either a ‘universal’ primer ITS1 or the fungal‐specific primer ITS1‐F, efficiently amplified DNA from all basidiomycetes and discriminated against ascomycete DNAs. The results with plants were not as clearcut. The ITS1‐F/ITS4‐B primer pair produced a small amount of PCR product for certain plant species, but the quantity was in most cases less than that produced by the ‘universal’ ITS primers. However, under conditions where both plant and fungal DNAs were present, the fungal DNA was amplified to the apparent exclusion of plant DNA. ITS1‐F/ITS4‐B preferential amplification was shown to be particularly useful for detection and analysis of the basidiomycete component in ectomycorrhizae and in rust‐infected tissues.

We characterized the genetics of developmental variation and phenotypic plasticity in trichome density, a putative defensive trait of Mimulus guttatus (yellow monkeyflower). Our results are evaluated in relation to the optimal defense theory, which provides testable predictions for plastic and developmental patterns in defense traits. We found that both developmental stage and simulated insect damage affected trichome production, but in different ways. Plants were more likely to produce at least some trichomes on later leaves than on earlier leaves, regardless of damage. Damage did not affect the average probability of producing trichomes, but it did increase the density of hairs on trichome-positive plants. We mapped trichome quantitative trait loci (QTL) by selectively genotyping a large panel of recombinant inbred lines derived from two highly divergent populations. Several highly pleiotropic QTL influenced multiple aspects of the trichome phenotype (constitutive, developmental, and/or plastic responses). Only one of the QTL influenced trichome induction following damage. In a result that is consistent with a central prediction of optimal defense theory, the high allele at this location was from the ancestral population with low constitutive trichome production. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.},

  abstract = {Climate is a potent selective force in natural populations, yet the importance of adaptation in the response of plant species to past climate change has been questioned. As many species are unlikely to migrate fast enough to track the rapidly changing climate of the future, adaptation must play an increasingly important role in their response. In this paper we review recent work that has documented climate-related genetic diversity within populations or on the microgeographical scale. We then describe studies that have looked at the potential evolutionary responses of plant populations to future climate change. We argue that in fragmented landscapes, rapid climate change has the potential to overwhelm the capacity for adaptation in many plant populations and dramatically alter their genetic composition. The consequences are likely to include unpredictable changes in the presence and abundance of species within communities and a reduction in their ability to resist and recover from further environmental perturbations, such as pest and disease outbreaks and extreme climatic events. Overall, a range-wide increase in extinction risk is likely to result. We call for further research into understanding the causes and consequences of the maintenance and loss of climate-related genetic diversity within populations. ©2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

One goal of our research is to develop a linkage map based upon microsatellite loci in Mimulus guttatus and the selfing derivative M. nasutus in order to examine the genetics of one such transition. Here we present 19 primer pairs that detect polymorphisms between these two species. Within-population allelic surveys demonstrate the value of these markers for detailed analysis of population structure. We have found also that many of the microsatellites are conserved in more distantly related Mimulus species, and may thus serve as useful genetic markers for population genetic and comparative mapping studies within this diverse genus.},

  abstract = {Microbial endophytes are present in all known plant species. The ability to enter and thrive in the plant tissues makes endophytes unique, showing multidimensional interactions within the host plant. Several vital activities of the host plant are known to be influenced by the presence of endophytes. They can promote plant growth, elicit defense response against pathogen attack, and can act as remediators of abiotic stresses. To date, most of the research has been done assuming that the interaction of endophytes with the host plant is similar to the plant growth-promoting (PGP) microbes present in the rhizosphere. However, a new appreciation of the difference of the rhizosphere environment from that of internal plant tissues is gaining attention. It would be interesting to explore the impact of endosymbionts on the host’s gene expression, metabolism, and other physiological aspects essential in conferring resistance against biotic and abiotic stresses. A more intriguing and inexplicable issue with many endophytes that has to be critically evaluated is their ability to produce host metabolites, which can be harnessed on a large scale for potential use in diverse areas. In this review, we discuss the concept of endophytism, looking into the latest insights related to the multifarious interactions beneficial for the host plant and exploring the importance of these associations in agriculture and the environment and in other vital aspects such as human health.},

  abstract = {Fungal symbionts can buffer plants from environmental extremes and may affect host capacities to acclimate, adapt, or redistribute under environmental change; however, the distributions of fungal symbionts along abiotic gradients are poorly described. Fungal mutualists should be the most beneficial in abiotically stressful environments, and the structure of networks of plant-fungal interactions likely shift along gradients, even when fungal community composition does not track environmental stress. We sampled 634 unique combinations of fungal endophytes and mycorrhizal fungi, grass species identities, and sampling locations from 66 sites across six replicate altitudinal gradients in the western Colorado Rocky Mountains. The diversity and composition of leaf endophytic, root endophytic, and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal guilds and the overall abundance of fungal functional groups (pathogens, saprotrophs, mutualists) tracked grass host identity more closely than elevation. Network structures of root endophytes become more nested and less specialized at higher elevations, but network structures of other fungal guilds did not vary with elevation. Overall, grass species identity had overriding influence on the diversity and composition of above- and belowground fungal endophytes and AM fungi, despite large environmental variation. Therefore, in our system climate change may rarely directly affect fungal symbionts. Instead, fungal symbiont distributions will most likely track the range dynamics of host grasses.},

  abstract = {Taxon-specific small RNA loci are widespread in eukaryotic genomes, yet their role in lineage-specific adaptation, phenotypic diversification, and speciation is poorly understood. Here, we report that a speciation locus in monkeyflowers (               Mimulus               ),               YELLOW UPPER               (               YUP               ), contains an inverted repeat region that produces small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in a phased pattern. Although the inverted repeat is derived from a partial duplication of a protein-coding gene that is not involved in flower pigmentation, one of the siRNAs targets and represses a master regulator of floral carotenoid pigmentation.               YUP               emerged with two protein-coding genes that control other aspects of flower coloration as a “superlocus” in a subclade of               Mimulus               and has contributed to subsequent phenotypic diversification and pollinator-mediated speciation in the descendant species.                        ,              Noncoding gene drives floral speciation                            In monkeyflowers (               Mimulus               spp.), variation in the               YELLOW UPPER               (               YUP               ) genetic locus causes changes in flower color patterns that in turn drive speciation with shifts in whether the flower is pollinated by bees or by hummingbirds. Liang               et al               . show that the locus does not encode a protein (see the Perspective by Monniaux). Instead,               YUP               produces phased small interfering RNAs that regulate floral carotenoid pigmentation. Revealing the opportunistic nature of evolution, the locus evolved from a fragment of a gene encoding a cytochrome protein not involved in floral pigment production. —PJH                        ,                             A genetic locus–involved               Mimulus               speciation encodes a set of small regulatory RNAs.},

However, the high performance commercial SPRI beads have no price advantage over our method. Furthermore, the use of commercially available SPRI beads standards does not provide the flexibility required for a number of specific nucleic acid handling scenarios.                                         Results                                We report an efficient DNA purification strategy by combining home-made beads-suspension buffer with SPRI beads. The method tests the critical concentrations of polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000 and beads to maximise recovery. And the composition of the SPRI beads DNA purification system (SDPS) was determined at 20\% PEG 8000, 2\,M NaCl and 16.3\,mM MgCl                 2                 , and 1.25\,mg/ml beads (1/8th original concentration). Then, we tested the DNA recovery of the SDPS, and the result showed that it was comparable to the control (AMPure XP beads). In the study, we have also developed an adjustment SPRI beads DNA purification system (ASDPS), the volume of ASDPS per reaction is 0.6× reaction volume (beads/samples). The performance of ASDPS is similar to SDPS and the control. But the cost of our methods is only about 1/24th of the control. To further assess its performance, we prepare the DNA-seq libraries to evaluate the yield, library quality, capture efficiency and consistency. We have compared all these results with the performance of the control and confirmed its efficiency.                                                        Conclusion               We have proposed an alternative DNA purification approach with great flexibility, allowing researchers to manipulate DNA in different conditions. And ultimately, its application will benefit molecular biology research in the future.},

Despite recent advances in our knowledge of the ecology and molecular biology of this mutualistic symbiosis, our understanding of the AM fungi genome biology is just emerging. Presented here is a close to T2T genome assembly of the model AM fungus Rhizophagus irregularis DAOM197198, achieved through Nanopore long-read DNA sequencing and Hi-C data. This haploid genome assembly of R. irregularis, alongside short- and long-read RNA-Sequencing data, was used to produce a comprehensive annotation catalog of gene models, repetitive elements, small RNA loci, and DNA cytosine methylome. A phylostratigraphic gene age inference framework revealed that the birth of genes associated with nutrient transporter activity and transmembrane ion transport systems predates the emergence of Glomeromycotina. While nutrient cycling in AM fungi relies on genes that existed in ancestor lineages, a burst of Glomeromycotina-restricted genetic innovation is also detected. Analysis of the chromosomal distribution of genetic and epigenetic features highlights evolutionarily young genomic regions that produce abundant small RNAs, suggesting active RNA-based monitoring of genetic sequences surrounding recently evolved genes. This chromosome-scale view of the genome of an AM fungus genome reveals previously unexplored sources of genomic novelty in an organism evolving under an obligate symbiotic life cycle.},

In tropical forests, tree diversity is structured by edaphic factors, climate, and biotic interactions, with seasonality playing an essential role at landscape scales: wetter and less seasonal forests typically harbor higher tree diversity than more seasonal forests. We posited that the abiotic factors shaping tree diversity extend to hyperdiverse symbionts in leaves—fungal endophytes—that influence plant health, function, and resilience to stress. Through surveys in forests across Panama that considered climate, seasonality, and covarying biotic factors, we demonstrate that endophyte richness varies negatively with temperature seasonality. Endophyte community structure and taxonomic composition reflect both temperature seasonality and climate (mean annual temperature and precipitation). Overall our findings highlight the vital role of climate-related factors in shaping the hyperdiversity of these important and little-known symbionts of the trees that, in turn, form the foundations of tropical forest biodiversity.},

Here, we test this hypothesis with factorial experiments addressing the role of microbes in local adaptation of Hypericum perforatum (St. John’s wort) to stressful limestone barrens (alvars) compared to neighboring old-fields. Alvar plants benefited more from microbes in early life history stages, while at later growth stages, alvar and old-field plants benefited equally from microbes but only in the old-field habitat. Patterns of local adaptation were changed by the presence of microbes. Alvar plants grown in association with alvar microbes outperformed old-field plants in the alvar habitat, whereas old-field plants showed patterns of maladaptation when grown with microbes. In this demonstration of microbe-mediated adaptation, we show that rhizosphere microbes can be important for plant fitness and patterns of local adaptation but that those effects are dependent on lifehistory stage and habitat.},

Parent strains are selected based on phenotype, marker availability, and compatibility, and theymay be genetically engineered to remove unwanted variation or to introduce reporters. A construction design scheme is determined, including the target population size, if and how advanced intercrossing will be done, and the number of generations of inbreeding. Parent crosses and F1 crosses are performed to create an F2 population. Depending on design, advanced intercrossing may be implemented to increasemapping resolution through the accumulation ofadditional meiotic crossover events. Finally, lines are inbred to create genetically stable recombinant lines.

Plant leaves usually contain high levels of carbohydrates and secondary metabolites that can impact DNA purity, affecting downstream applications. Several protocols and kits are available for HMW DNA extraction, but they usually require a high amount of input material and often lead to substantial DNA fragmentation, making sequencing suboptimal in terms of read length and data yield. We here describe a protocol for plant HMW DNA extraction from low input material (0.1 g) which is easy to follow and quick (2.5 h). This method successfully enabled us to extract HMW from four species from different families (Orchidaceae, Poaceae, Brassicaceae, Asteraceae). In the case of recalcitrant species, we show that an additional purification step is sufficient to deliver a clean DNA sample. We demonstrate the suitability of our protocol for long-read sequencing on the Oxford Nanopore Technologies PromethION               ®               platform, with and without the use of a short fragment depletion kit.},

Its central tenet - that recruits experience high mortality near conspecifics and at high densities - assumes a degree of host specialization in interactions between plants and natural enemies. Studies confirming JC effects have focused primarily on spatial distributions of seedlings and saplings, leaving major knowledge gaps regarding the fate of seeds in soil and the specificity of the soilborne fungi that are their most important antagonists. Here we use a common garden experiment in a lowland tropical forest in Panama to show that communities of seed-infecting fungi are structured predominantly by plant species, with only minor influences of factors such as local soil type, forest characteristics, or time in soil (1- 12 months). Inoculation experiments confirmed that fungi affected seed viability and germination in a host-specific manner and that effects on seed viability preceded seedling emergence. Seeds are critical components of reproduction for tropical trees, and the factors influencing their persistence, survival, and germination shape the populations of seedlings and saplings on which current perspectives regarding forest dynamics are based. Together these findings bring seed dynamics to light in the context of the JC hypothesis, implicating them directly in the processes that have emerged as critical for diversity maintenance in species-rich tropical forests.},

  abstract = {Abstract           Considering it is common to find as much as 100-fold variation in the number of 16S rRNA gene sequences found across samples in a study, researchers need to control for the effect of uneven sequencing effort. How to do this has become a contentious question. Some have argued that rarefying or rarefaction is “inadmissible” because it omits valid data. A number of alternative approaches have been developed to normalize and rescale the data that purport to be invariant to the number of observations. I generated community distributions based on 12 published datasets where I was able to assess the ability of multiple methods to control for uneven sequencing effort. Rarefaction was the only method that could control for variation in uneven sequencing effort when measuring commonly used alpha and beta diversity metrics. Next, I compared the false detection rate and power to detect true differences between simulated communities with a known effect size using various alpha and beta diversity metrics. Although all methods of controlling for uneven sequencing effort had an acceptable false detection rate when samples were randomly assigned to two treatment groups, rarefaction was consistently able to control for differences in sequencing effort when sequencing depth was confounded with treatment group. Finally, the statistical power to detect differences in alpha and beta diversity metrics was consistently the highest when using rarefaction. These simulations underscore the importance of using rarefaction to normalize the number of sequences across samples in amplicon sequencing analyses.                        Importance             Sequencing 16S rRNA gene fragments has become a fundamental tool for understanding the diversity of microbial communities and the factors that affect their diversity. Due to technical challenges, it is common to observe wide variation in the number of sequences that are collected from different samples within the same study. However, the diversity metrics used by microbial ecologists are sensitive to differences in sequencing effort. Therefore, tools are needed to control for the uneven levels of sequencing. This simulation-based analysis shows that despite a longstanding controversy, rarefaction is the most robust approach to control for uneven sequencing effort. The controversy started because of confusion over the definition of rarefaction and violation of assumptions that are made by methods that have been borrowed from other fields. Microbial ecologists should use rarefaction.},

While many studies address the impact of climate change on plants and mechanisms of their resilience to climate stressors, the role of the plant microbiome in aiding plants' adaptation to climate change has been less investigated. We argue here that fungal endophytes, an important constituent of the plant microbiome, may be key to the ability of plants to adapt to climatic stressors. The rapid adaptive response of endophytes coupled with their ability to ‘transfer’ resistance to their hosts may fast-track plants' adaptation to climate change. We briefly review the importance of Class 3 fungal endophytes of terrestrial plants and discuss how they may accelerate adaptations to climate change in crops and natural plant communities and call for efforts directed at improving the understanding of fungal endophyte-facilitated plant health. Such information could aid in devising improved strategies for mitigating climate change effects on plant communities.},

  abstract = {Leaf traits of plants worldwide are classified according to the Leaf Economics Spectrum (LES), which links leaf functional traits to evolutionary life history strategies. As a continuum ranging from thicker, tough leaves that are low in nitrogen (N) to thinner, softer, leaves that are high in N, the LES brings together physical, chemical, and ecological traits. Fungal endophytes are common foliar symbionts that occur in healthy, living leaves, especially in tropical forests. Their community composition often differs among co-occurring host species in ways that cannot be explained by environmental conditions or host phylogenetic relationships. Here, we tested the over-arching hypothesis that LES traits act as habitat filters that shape communities of endophytes both in terms of composition, and in terms of selecting for endophytes with particular suites of functional traits. We used culture-based and culture-free surveys to characterize foliar endophytes in mature leaves of 30 phylogenetically diverse plant species with divergent LES traits in lowland Panama, and then measured functional traits of dominant endophyte taxa               in vitro               . Endophytes were less abundant and less diverse in thick, tough, leaves compared to thin, softer, leaves in the same forest, even in closely related plants. Endophyte communities differed according to leaf traits, including leaf punch strength and carbon and nitrogen content. The most common endophyte taxa in leaves at different ends of the LES differ in their cellulase, protease, chitinase, and antipathogen activity. Our results extend the LES framework for the first time to diverse and ecologically important endophytes, opening new hypotheses regarding the degree to which foliar symbionts respond to, and extend, the functional traits of leaves they inhabit.},

We measured leaf fungal diversity with amplicon sequencing across an entire growing season in a diversity panel of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum). We also sampled a replicated subset of genotypes across 3 additional sites to compare the importance of time, space, ecology, and genetics. We found a strong successional pattern in the microbiome shaped both by host genetics and environmental factors. Further, we used genome-wide association (GWA) mapping and RNA sequencing to show that 3 cysteine-rich receptor-like kinases (crRLKs) were linked to a genetic locus associated with microbiome structure. We confirmed GWAS results in an independent set of genotypes for both the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and large subunit (LSU) ribosomal DNA markers. Fungal pathogens were central to microbial covariance networks, and genotypes susceptible to pathogens differed in their expression of the 3 crRLKs, suggesting that host immune genes are a principal means of controlling the entire leaf microbiome.},

  abstract = {Divergent selection across the landscape can favor the evolution of local adaptation in populations experiencing contrasting conditions. Local adaptation is widely observed in a diversity of taxa, yet we have a surprisingly limited understanding of the mechanisms that give rise to it. For instance, few have experimentally confirmed the biotic and abiotic variables that promote local adaptation, and fewer yet have identified the phenotypic targets of selection that mediate local adaptation. Here, we highlight critical gaps in our understanding of the process of local adaptation and discuss insights emerging from in-depth investigations of the agents of selection that drive local adaptation, the phenotypes they target, and the genetic basis of these phenotypes. We review historical and contemporary methods for assessing local adaptation, explore whether local adaptation manifests differently across life history, and evaluate constraints on local adaptation.},

  abstract = {Upon inbreeding, the architecture of the inbreeding load shifts as selection purges strongly deleterious recessive mutations and drift fixes many milder ones. Most small inbred populations show limited genetic variation while crosses between such populations commonly express pronounced heterosis, confirming fixation. In contrast, purging appears to be limited in that inbred populations often retain substantial inbreeding depression. In addition we have the enigma Darwin noted: purely selfing taxa are unknown. Because both purging and fixation reduce inbreeding depression and load, another mechanism must exist to sustain these. Background selection and the associations that develop among alleles in small inbred populations will shift the architecture of the load potentially creating blocks of recessive mutations linked in repulsion. This would generate pseudo-overdominance that could sustain these \&ldquo;PODs\&rdquo; and inbreeding load. Recombination and crosses between lineages could erode PODs. Crosses between populations fixed for different mutations would generate high pseudo-overdominance, enhancing heterosis and potentially POD formation. New recessive mutations arising within PODs would reinforce overdominance. PODs should generate clear genetic signatures including genomic hotspots of heterozygosity and linkage disequilibrium containing alleles at intermediate frequency generating segregating load. Results from several simulation and empirical studies match these predictions. Further simulations and comparative genomic analyses are needed to rigorously test whether PODs exist in sufficient strength and number to generate persistent inbreeding depression and load in inbred lineages.},

  abstract = {Reproductive isolation (RI) is a core concept in evolutionary biology. It has been the central focus of speciation research since the modern synthesis and is the basis by which biological species are defined. Despite this, the term is used in seemingly different ways, and attempts to quantify RI have used very different approaches. After showing that the field lacks a clear definition of the term, we attempt to clarify key issues, including what RI is, how it can be quantified in principle, and how it can be measured in practice. Following other definitions with a genetic focus, we propose that RI is a quantitative measure of the effect that genetic differences between populations have on gene flow. Specifically, RI compares the flow of neutral alleles in the presence of these genetic differences to the flow without any such differences. RI is thus greater than zero when genetic differences between populations reduce the flow of neutral alleles between populations. We show how RI can be quantified in a range of scenarios. A key conclusion is that RI depends strongly on circumstances—­ including the spatial, temporal and genomic context—­making it difficult to compare across systems. After reviewing methods for estimating RI from data, we conclude that it is difficult to measure in practice. We discuss our findings in light of the goals of speciation research and encourage the use of methods for estimating RI that integrate organismal and genetic approaches.},

In addition, we present the genomic resources currently available for Mimulus and discuss future directions for research.

However, only recently has it been realized that this system also holds great promise for studying the developmental genetics and evo-devo of important plant traits that are not found in well-established model systems such as Arabidopsis. Here, I review recent progress in four different areas of plant research enabled by this new model, including transcriptional regulation of carotenoid biosynthesis, formation of periodic pigmentation patterns, developmental genetics of corolla tube formation and elaboration, and the molecular basis of floral trait divergence underlying pollinator shift. These examples suggest that Mimulus offers ample opportunities to make exciting discoveries in plant development and evolution.},
